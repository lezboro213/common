## "Fake" Async

Currently, AutoMapper is manipulating the [Event Loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop) to provide a "fake" async support for the `mapAsync()` and `mutateAsync()` variants.

```ts
//                  ðŸ‘‡ simplified for brevity
function mapAsync(...args) {
    const result = map(...args);
    return new Promise((res) => {
        setTimeout(res, 0, result);
    });
}

//                      ðŸ‘‡ simplified for brevity
function mutateAsync(...args) {
    return new Promise((res) => {
        mutate(...args);
        setTimeout(res);
    });
}
```

## Help wanted

Real async support can be achieved by some Isomorphic Worker that would execute the map operations on the Worker thread. However, AutoMapper implementation is full of `Function` which cannot be serialized (easily) to transfer to the Worker thread. If anyone wants to contribute Asynchronous support, I'm happy to walk you through the repository.
