Call `ignore()` on a property to skip the map operation for the property while still mark the property as _configured_. This ultimately prevents the ignored property from being checked by `assertUnmappedProperties()` and makes the property `undefined`

```ts
createMap(
    mapper,
    User,
    UserDto,
    forMember((d) => d.fullName, ignore())
);
```

`ignore()` sets the `TransformationType` to `TransformationType.Ignore`
