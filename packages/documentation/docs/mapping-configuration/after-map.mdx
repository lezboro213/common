As the name suggests, `afterMap()` sets up a `MapCallback` to be called **after** the map operation.

## Configure on `Mapping`

Pass `afterMap()` in `createMap()` to sets up the `MapCallback`

```ts
createMap(
    mapper,
    User,
    UserDto,
    afterMap((source, destination) => {})
);
```

## Configure on `map()`

Pass `afterMap` in `MapOptions` when calling `map()` to sets up the `MapCallback`

```ts
mapper.map(user, User, UserDto, {
    afterMap: (source, destination) => {},
});
```

:::info

-   `afterMap()` on `map()` has precedence over `Mapping`
-   For `mapArray` (and its variants), `afterMap()` on `Mapping` is **ignored** because it would be bad for performance if we run `afterMap` for each and every item of the array. `afterMap()` on `mapArray()` will be invoked with `(sourceArray, destinationArray)` instead

## Async Mapping

One of the common use-cases of `afterMap` is to execute some asynchronous operation. Let's assume our `Destination` have some property whose value can only be computed from an asynchronous operation, we can leverage `mapAsync()` and `afterMap()` for it.

```ts
createMap(
    mapper,
    User,
    UserDto,
    //                  ðŸ‘‡ We are fetching the "fullName" manually
    //                  ðŸ‘‡          ðŸ‘‡ so we need to ignore it
    forMember((d) => d.fullName, ignore()),
    afterMap(async (source, destination) => {
        const fullName = await fetchFullName(source);
        Object.assign(destination, { fullName });
    })
);

//                          ðŸ‘‡ mapAsync is needed if we use the above "trick" with afterMap
const dto = await mapper.mapAsync(user, User, UserDto);
```

:::caution

Simple asynchronous operations should be fine with this approach. However due to [Fake Async](../misc/fake-async), we should **NOT** use AutoMapper for a particular pair of models if those models require some heavy and complex asynchronous operations.

## What about `postMap`?

When create the `Mapper`, we can customize the `postMap` function on the `MappingStrategy`. The differences between `postMap` and `afterMap` are:

-   `postMap` runs after every **map** operation
-   There is only one `postMap` per `Mapper`
-   `postMap` runs **AFTER** `afterMap`
