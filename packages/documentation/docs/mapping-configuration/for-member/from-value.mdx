Call `fromValue()` and pass in a raw value to map to the configured property. If we pass in an object, the object will be mapped as-is without any consideration for nested Mapping.

```ts
createMap(
    mapper,
    User,
    UserDto,
    forMember((destination) => destination.fullName, fromValue('John Doe'))
);
```

`fromValue()` sets the `TransformationType` to `TransformationType.FromValue`
